## Ingredients:

* 4 cups cucumbers (about 3 smallish cucumbers)
* 1 cup sliced red bell pepper (about 1 small)
* 1 cup sliced sweet onion (about 1 medium)
* 2 tablespoons pickling salt
* 1 cup cider vinegar
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 tbsp mustard seed
* 1 tsp celery seed
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves

## Directions:

Prepare two clean pint jars and lids.

Combine sliced cucumbers, bell peppers, onion and pickling salt in a colander and set inside a large bowl. Refrigerate one hour to remove excess liquid. Rinse vegetables and discard liquid.

Combine vinegar and sugar in a large pot. Heat over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add the mustard seed, celery seed, red pepper flakes and cloves. Increase the heat to high and bring the bring to a boil.

Add drained vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for five minutes, until vegetables are fully heated through.

Using tongs, fill jars with vegetables to about 1/2 inch from top. Slowly pour hot brine over the vegetables, leaving 1/2 inch head space.

Tap jars to loosen air. Use a table knife to poke around in the jar to dislodge remaining bubbles. Check head space again and add more brine if necessary.

Let pickles cure at least 48 hours in the fridge before devouring.

**NOTE FOR NEXT TIME:** The veg might be more crisp if you skip boiling the vegetables and just cover them with hot brine?
