Sometimes you need a cookie recipe which requires an entire pound of butter. This is one such recipe.

## Ingredients

- 2 c (1 lb) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature
- 1-1/2 c sugar, plus extra for topping cookies
- 3-1/2 c flour
- 2 tsp vanilla or lemon extract or the zest and juice of a lemon

## Directions

1. Place the sugar into a blender and blend until fine and powdery. This will take four or five stops and starts of the blender.
2. Beat butter until light, and add sugar, beating until thoroughly incorporated. Add vanilla or lemon extract.
3. Add flour a little at a time, beating until dough comes together into a rough ball.
4. Roll dough into balls. To make large cookies (4-1/2″ across) use a 1/4 cup measuring cup of dough. To make smaller cookies (3″), use a rounded tablespoon of dough. Roll smoothly into balls and then roll in additional sugar.
5. Place on ungreased or parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees until edges are golden brown and cookie is firm, about 15 minutes.
