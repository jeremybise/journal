Time consuming, but fantastic for three simple ingredients.

## Ingredients

* 241g [sourdough starter](/sourdough-starter)
* 340g lukewarm water
* 602g flour, divided
* 2 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions

1. Combine starter, water and 362g of the flour in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature for four hours.

2. Refrigerate for 12 hours.

3. Add remaining 240g of flour and the salt and combine. Knead to form a smooth dough.

4. Allow to rise in a covered bowl until gas bubbles are visible (4-5+ hours.) Once per hour, transfer dough to a floured surface and stretch into a square shape. Pull corners into the center, reforming the ball.

5. Gently divide the ball in half and form into loaves. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet covered with lightly greased plastic wrap until very puffy (2-4+ hours.)

6. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

7. Spray loaves with lukewarm water. Slash each loaf deeply with a razer, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until deep golden brown.

8. Cool on a rack.
